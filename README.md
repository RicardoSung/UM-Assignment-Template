# UM-Assignment-Template

## A brief

This repository is an assignment template of [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/) based on XeLatex. 

Thanks to Peter Gam (@MrPeterJin) for providing the template of [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/zh-hans). And I've modified the original template to suit UM students, especially [AMSV](https://ime.um.edu.mo/) students. For students of other faculties, please change the `amsv.png` of *Line 60* `\rhead{\includegraphics[height=1.5cm]{amsv.png}}` to the proper school logo.

## Something Important

You need to install font style, [`TeX Gyre Termes Math`](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/tex-gyre-math-termes).
